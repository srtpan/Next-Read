# Next-Read

Your personal book concierge for discovering your next page turner.

## Description

I love reading and books I can talk about books for hours. When I closer to finishing a book, I always wonder **'What Should I Read Next'**?

I made use of Anthropic's model to create 'Next Read': An intelligent book recommendation application designed to help you, my dear reader, find your perfect next book. Next Read analyzes your reading preferences, favorite genres, and past reads to suggest books that you're likely to love.

## How It Works

Next Read uses the Anthropic API to analyze your inputs and generate personalized book recommendations. You provide a brief description of the book you wanna read next, like "A thriller set in a church" or "A murder mystery set in abookstore", optionally provide a book you have read in the genre which will enhance the recommendation provided.
